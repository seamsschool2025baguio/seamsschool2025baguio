		  <h4>Lecture 1: Numerical Methods for Infinite-Dimensional Optimization Problems</h4>
		  by <a href="https://math.upd.edu.ph/faculty/mohammad-rhudaina" target="_blank">Dr. Rhudaina Mohammad</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(University of the Philippines Diliman, Philippines)
		  <p>
			  This course introduces numerical methods and applications of infinite-dimensional optimization problems. Here, the solution can be a function, leading to problems that appear in the calculus of variations, inverse problem, and optimal control; or can be a shape, leading to problems that appear in shape and topology optimization. We start with the basics using tools from functional analysis. Then we present some numerical methods for both unconstrained and constrained problems, including their discretization.

		  <h4>Lecture 2: Numerical Solution of Inverse Problems in Natural Sciences using Intelligent Systems</h4>
		  by <a href="https://math.upd.edu.ph/faculty/mendoza-renier" target="_blank">Dr. Renier Mendoza</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(University of the Philippines Diliman, Philippines)
		  <p>
			  Inverse problems are fundamental in creating precise models across natural sciences. Traditional approaches often struggle with the complexity and high dimensionality of typical datasets in these fields. To solve these problems, this lecture will explore intelligent systems, including machine learning algorithms and metaheuristic optimization. We will explore how these advanced methods can enhance the accuracy and reliability of model predictions and reveal patterns that conventional techniques may miss. We present real-world examples.

		  <h4>Lecture 3: Inverse Problems and Regularization</h4>
		  by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mathisreal/home" target="_blank">Dr. Rommel Real</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(University of the Philippines Mindanao, Philippines)
		  <p>
			  <!-- Inverse problems aim to solve the parameters given an observed or desired effect. These problems often lead to  mathematical models that are inherently ill-posed. In many inverse problems, exact data are not available, instead, only noisy data are available. Hence, to obtain stable approximate solutions, regularization is used. In this course we introduce basic mathematical background to study ill-posed linear inverse problems necessary to study the convergence of two basic regularization methods, Tikhonov regularization and the Landweber iteration. Numerical examples will also be demonstrated, which includes applications to imaging. -->
			  Inverse problems aim to solve the parameters given an observed or desired effect. These problems often lead to mathematical models that are inherently ill-posed. In many inverse problems, exact data are not available, instead, only noisy data are available. Using the linear deconvolution problem as a model, we will demonstrate ill-posedness of the inverse problems in finite-dimensional space, and how regularization overcomes this ill-posedness. We will focus on Tikhonov regularization for linear inverse problems, with a special attention on choosing the regularization parameter. Finally we will examine the total variation regularization to solve solutions with specific properties.<br><br>

			  This course will use MATLAB to demonstrate the numerics of the course.

		  <h4>Lecture 4: Mathematical Models and Inverse Problems in Medical Image Reconstruction </h4>
		  by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rISDhsMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Evelyn Cueva</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Chile)
		  <p>
			  <!-- This course offers an in-depth exploration of the mathematical foundations and techniques essential to computed tomography (CT), a critical tool in biomedical imaging. We will begin by examining the physics underlying the Radon transform, a key concept in the projection of multi-dimensional data. The course will then explore the slice Fourier theorem, which connects the Radon transform with the Fourier transform, providing the theoretical basis for image reconstruction. Participants will gain insights into the role of image discretization in transforming continuous models into practical algorithms. We will also cover the formation and interpretation of sinograms, which represent the CT measurement data. The course will culminate with a discussion on reconstructing images using these sinograms, starting with the classical filtered back-projection formula. Designed for researchers and practitioners in mathematical modeling, inverse problems, and biomedical engineering, this course offers a comprehensive understanding of how advanced mathematical tools are applied to real-world challenges in medical imaging. -->
			  This lecture presents the reconstruction of medical images as an ill-posed inverse problem, focusing on the mathematical models and computational methods that enable recovery from incomplete data. Emphasis is placed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), described through the Fourier model, and on strategies to address accelerated acquisitions and data undersampling. The session reviews key approaches from Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing to deep learning–based reconstructions, highlighting the role of regularization and physics-informed priors. Participants will gain an integrated view of how modern mathematical modeling connects theory and computation in medical imaging.<br><br>

			    The hands-on labs will be conducted in Python using Jupyter Notebooks, prepared to run directly on Google Colab. No local installation will be required.

		  <h4>Lecture 5: Introduction to Optimal Control</h4>
		  by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tania-biswas/" target="_blank">Dr. Tania Biswas</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Charles University, Czech Republic)
		  <p>
			  The optimal control problem can be viewed as a cost functional to be minimized subject to a partial differential equation describing the motion, a control function which can be taken in a boundary condition, an initial condition, a coefficient in a partial differential equation, or any parameter in the equation. The control may be chosen, while the state is uniquely determined by the solution of the differential equations. Our aim is to choose a control in such a way that the cost functional is minimized. Such controls are called optimal control and the corresponding state is called optimal state. In these lectures, I will introduce the basic tools to prove the existence of solutions to optimal control problems and its characterization by deriving first order optimality conditions. Moreover, I will also discuss some applications of optimal control problems in real life.

	  <h4>Lecture 6: Stability of Optimal Controls for Affine Problems</h4>
	  by <a href="https://jsimonmath.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Dr. John Sebastian Simon</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Universit&auml;t Koblenz, Germany)
	  <p>
		  This lecture addresses a box constrained optimal control problem with a linear objective functional in relation to the control, often leading to bang-bang solutions that lack regularity. To address this, Tikhonov regularization is employed. The lecture investigates the stability of optimal controls for the regularized problem by introducing strong Holder subregularity (sHs). Conditions for sHs are established and applied to problems governed by semilinear and quasilinear parabolic equations. The sHs for the optimality map is proved, demonstrating stability not only under Tikhonov regularization but also for perturbations in initial data and source functions.
